# Meetings

## Introduction
In this new hybrid world there are many challenges ahead.  This is our current attempt as a team to navigate.  We know we're wrong at least in some ways, but will bravely move forward, learn, and then adjust as appropriate.

## Definition
To distinguish team gatherings that fall into the guidelines below from others, we should define what we mean by a meeting. 
- A **Meeting** - for the context of our principles and guidelines below - is any gathering of the team where a planned discussion or decision is made that will long lived (more than a week). 
- Team social events (such as the weekly Prague Coffee Break or the Redmond Happy Hour), Stand Up (the daily one in Prague, the twice weekly one in Redmond, and the daily FR one), and 1:1 do not meet our definition of a meeting. 

## Principles
- All of our meetings must be inclusive of everyone who wants to participate.
- Meetings should be reserved for situations and discussions that are unreasonable or silly to have async.
- Meetings are an important, necessary, and key part of belonging.

## Guidelines
- Every meeting is a Teams meeting.  (regardless if synchronous or async)
- Every meeting has recording turned on by default
- Notes that articulate the main points discussed and conclusion are sent out after every meeting that is of general concern.  
- When folks are meeting physically together, laptops (or other devices) should be used to aid remote folks.  (see logistics note below)
- The meeting organizer should *always* have a laptop.
- It's probably better to schedule meetings in a conference room and/or focus room so as to not disrupt the team room.  However, there are undoubtedly times when having the meeting in the team room is appropriate.

## Logistics
- A pool of laptops is available which can be 'checked out' and used for meetings.  At this time, there's probably not enough for everyone, but we do have a few already.  Also, most devs now already have a laptop which is helpful.
- Meeting notes:
  - V-Team meeting notes are posted in the v-team channel in Teams.
  - Inter-Team notes are sent to the invite list.
  - General team meeting notes are sent to the whole team alias. 
  
## Posible Feature Requests
- Teams to add the ability to auto deep link portions of the transcript
